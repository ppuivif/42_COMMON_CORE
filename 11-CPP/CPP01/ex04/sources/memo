Could you give an explanation of this line :
this->infileStream.open(infile.c_str(), std::ifstream::in)

This line of code appears to be written in C++, and it involves working with file streams. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. this->infileStream
This refers to a member variable infileStream of the current class or object (denoted by this).
infileStream is likely an instance of the std::ifstream class, which is used for input file operations in C++.

2. .open(infile.c_str(), std::ifstream::in)

infile.c_str():
infile is a variable (most likely a std::string) that stores the name of the file to be opened.
The c_str() method converts the std::string to a C-style null-terminated character array (const char*) because older C++ I/O functions require this format.

std::ifstream::in:
This is an optional argument specifying the file mode. std::ifstream::in is the default mode, which means the file is opened for reading.
What This Line Does
It opens the file specified by infile for reading.
The file is associated with the infileStream object.
If the file opens successfully, infileStream can now be used to read data from the file.
