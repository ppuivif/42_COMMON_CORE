Could you explain me what is the command : http://<ip>:<port>

Certainly! The syntax http://<ip>:<port> is used to access a resource (like a website, web application, or API) running on a specific IP address and port number. Here’s what each part means:

http://:

This is the protocol used to access the resource. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for communication over the web.
If the connection is secure (using SSL/TLS), you would use https:// instead.
<ip>:

This is the IP address of the server hosting the resource.
It can be an IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or an IPv6 address (e.g., [2001:0db8::1]).
You can also use a domain name (e.g., example.com) instead of the IP address.
<port>:

This specifies the port number on the server where the resource or service is running.
Common ports include:
80 for HTTP (default, often omitted).
443 for HTTPS (default, often omitted).
Custom ports are used for specific applications or services (e.g., 8080, 3000, etc.).
Example:
http://192.168.1.10:8080
This would connect to a server at IP 192.168.1.10 on port 8080 using HTTP.

https://example.com:8443
This would connect to the domain example.com on port 8443 using HTTPS.

Why specify the port?
In many cases, default ports are used, so you don’t need to specify them explicitly (e.g., http://example.com assumes port 80). However, if a service is running on a non-standard port, you must specify the port number to connect to it properly.
