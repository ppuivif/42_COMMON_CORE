TCP (transmission Control Protocol) is a communication protocol to ensure data is sent and
receive accurately between devices.

It's a list of rules/standards for how data should be sent and received between devices.
These rules/standards are divided into layers.

Layer 4 (application) : end-user software
e.g. : web browsers, email clients

Layer 3 (transport) : end to end communication
	- ports TCP
		e.g. : 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS), 25(SMTP)
	- ports UDP
		e.g. : 53(DNS), 67(DHCP)
NB : ports are numerical identifiers used to distinguish between different services or
applications running on a device

Layer 2 (internet) : manage addressing and routing of packets

Layer 1 (link) : manage physical transmission of data over a network
e.g. : transmission via Ethernet cables

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN (Local Area Network) :

It has a network of devices talking to each other within a limited range.
For example, your home network has multiple devices connected with each other and talking to each
other.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IP (Internet Protocol) :

It's an address of a device in the network allocated by a router.
IP addresses helps to identify and locate a device on a local area network.
More importantly, IP adresses help devices talk to each other like how mobile phones have phone
numbers and houses have street addresses.
Every device has a unique IP address and the 2 main versions are the IPv4 (32-bit) which look like :
192.168.1.1
and the IPv6 which looks like this :
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
We don't really need to worry about the IPv6 for net practice because we only need IPv4.
An IP address has four octets separated by dots :
	192.  168.  1.  1
in which :
	192.  168.  1. is called the network portion
and in which the fourth octet :
	1  is called the host portion
A host just means a device like a phone or a computer, etc.

A host will be assigned a usable address so this means within a network there will always be 2 IP
reserved and unusable we cannot touch it.They are :
	- the network address (first IP of the network) : 192.168.1.0
	- the broadcast address (last IP of the network) : 192.168.1.255
So the usable IP range in this network begin at 192.168.1.1 and end at 192.168.1.254.
This means a host within this network can be assigned at the portion of an IP anywhere from 1 to 254.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subnet :

If we look at a device from another network, to indicate that a device belong to a specific
network we use subnets.
The subnet is used to identify the network from its outside.

Basically, the subnet is defined by address of the network (untouchable address) : 192.168.1.0,
(the first IP address in the range).
To represent subnet in a CIDR notation we use /24 (specifically for the case 192.168.1.0).
The CIDR notation specifies the subnet mask in a shortened format indicating how many bits are
used for the network portion.
If we take a subnet mask /24 (in CIDER notation), it match with the decimal notation :
255.255.255.0
In binary, it's a bunch (grappe) of ones and zeros.
In a subnet masks, all the ones indicate how many bits are taken for the network portion making
it
fixed. And the zeros indicate how many addresses are possible.
Summary : 
	- a subnet is a sub network of a larger network,
	- it defines a range of IP addresses in a network,
	- it helps us to determine whether a machine or device belongs to a particular network,
	- a subnet is essentially the network address with the CIDR notation representing a
	subnet mask,
		e.g. : subnet 192.163.1.0 /24
	- a subnet mask tells us how many bits is used for the network (fixed) and how many
	hosts a network can have (variable)
		e.g. : subnet mask /24 or 255.255.255.0

Method to determinate the first and last addresses and to determinate the range or CIDR notation

	1-convert a subnet mask from decimal notation to Binary :
		- each octet has 8 bits,
		- the ones tell us the network bits,
		- the zeros tell us the host bits,
		- each bit represents a power of 2,
		- we begin from the right and the first bit indicate the power 0, the second
		the power 1, etc, ...

e.g. :
	2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1

	2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
	128	64	32	16	 8	 4	 2	 1
	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1	 1

1 x 2^0 + 1 x 2^1 + ... + 1 x 2^7 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255

e.g. :
If we have a subnet mask : 255.255.255.240, and if we take the fourth octet (240)
In binary we have :

	2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
	128	64	32	16	 8	 4	 2	 1
	 1	 1	 1	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0

0 x 2^0 + 0 x 2^1 + ... + 1 x 2^7 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240
We can see that 4 bits are taken for network adress, and 4 bits left for host adresses

e.g. :
If we have a subnet mask : 255.255.255.128, we take the fourth octet (128)
In binary we have :

	2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
	128	64	32	16	 8	 4	 2	 1
	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0

0 x 2^0 + 0 x 2^1 + ... + 1 x 2^7 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 128 = 128
We can see that 1 bit is taken for network adress, and 7 bits left for host adresses

	2-find the CIDR notation :
We just count all the network bits out of the total 32 bits.
If we have /25, 32 - 25 = 7 bits left for host adresses.

If we want to have more than one network :

	- to have 2 networks :

	if we have a subnet : 192.168.42.128 /25
	the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.128

	the first network address will be 192.168.42.0
	the broadcast address will be 192.168.42.127
	the usable IP address range will be 192.168.42.1 to 192.168.42.126

	the second network address will be 192.168.42.128
	the broadcast address will be 192.168.42.255
	the usable IP address range will be 192.168.42.129 to 192.168.42.254

	- to have more than 2 networks (subnetting), you have to hack more host bits
	
	we could start off with a single network defined by subnet 192.168.1.0 /24
	the IP address range will be 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 (0 and 255 not usable for
	hosts)

	if we want 4 networks instead of one, we need to work out how many bits we need to
	hack (nous devons déterminer le nombre de bits à pirater).
		- if we hack 0 bit, we would create 2^0 = 1 network (no change),
		- if we hack 1 bit, we would create 2^1 = 2 networks,
		- if we hack 2 bits, we would create 2^2 = 4 networks.
	In this case we have a subnet mask in Binary representation :
		11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
	In Decimal representation :
		    255 .   255  .   255  . 192 (128 + 64 = 192)
	In CIDR notation : /26
	The first network address is : 192.162.1.0
	To determine the first network broadcast address we need to find the size of each
	Network (how many hosts can we have in each network) we need to find the increment of
	the last network bit referring to the power of two's chart.
	In the present case 255.255.255.192, each chunk counts :
		2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
		128	64	32	16	 8	 4	 2	 1
		 1	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0

1 x 2^0 + 1 x 2^1 + 1 x 2^2 + ... + 0 x 2^6 + 0 x 2^7 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 0 + 0 = 64
	
	so the first network broadcast address is : 192.162.1.63
	the usable IP range for the first network is 192.162.1.1 to 192.162.1.62
	
	The second network address is : 192.162.1.64
	the first network broadcast address is : 192.162.1.127
	the usable IP range for the first network is 192.162.1.65 to 192.162.1.126
	
	The third network address is : 192.162.1.128
	the first network broadcast address is : 192.162.1.191
	the usable IP range for the first network is 192.162.1.129 to 192.162.1.190
	
	The third network address is : 192.162.1.192
	the first network broadcast address is : 192.162.1.255
	the usable IP range for the first network is 192.162.1.193 to 192.162.1.254

To recap subnetting :
	step 1 : convert the subnet mask to binary
		-> refer to the power of 2 position chart (tableau des positions)
	step 2 : find the CIDR notation
		-> total of network bits
	step 3 : find the increment
		-> last network bit
	step 4 : create the networks and find the ranges for each
		-> include the network and broadcast addresses which are always reserved

What is a switch :

It's a physical device that sits inside a local area network (LAN).
It connects multiple devices within the local area network.
It help these devices talk to each other. It allows simultaneous communication.
It manages where data is sent and receives (it manages traffic, forwarding data to intended
recipient).
A switch can also be connected to a router.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a router :

A router is a physical device, networking device.
It sits between the LAN and the external network (WAN), for example the internet.
It connects the LAN to the WAN.
Router operate at the internet layer of the transmission control protocol or if we referring to
the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) that would be the network layer.
Routers connect us to the internet and other networks (this is called the Wider Area Network :
WAN).
Routers can have multiple IP addresses for different networks.
It uses routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel and forwards data packets
between the multiple networks.
For example, a mobile phone wants to connect to the internet. It sends a request to the router
then the router connects it to the internet if it approves.


OSI : le modèle OSI est une norme de communication de tous les systèmes informatiques en réseau.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a gateway :

A gateway and a router is often the same device which can be confusing.
The only difference is their function :
	- the router routes data packets between different networks and determines the best path
	for data to travel based on IP addresses,
	- a gateway acts as a gate between two networks, allowing them to communicate. It can
	connect networks that use different communication protocols as well.

A gateway has a single IP address which is of the router that serves as the entry and exit point
for a network.
(Une passerelle possède une seule adresse IP, celle du routeur qui sert de point d'entrée et de
sortie à un réseau.)

Useful chart :


CIDR (host bits in the 3rd and 4th octets)	/17	/18	/19	/20	/21	/22	/23	/24
CIDR (host bits in the 4th octet)		/25	/26	/27	/28	/29	/30	/31	/32

Could a router be used as a switch ?  

ChatGPT said:
Yes, a router can often be used as a switch, but only under certain conditions. Here’s how and why this works:

Key Points
Switch Functionality in Routers:

Most modern routers have built-in Ethernet ports designed for connecting multiple devices. These ports act as a simple switch when devices are connected to them.
Traffic between devices on these ports does not need to go through the router's core routing functions, so the devices can communicate as if they were connected to a standalone switch.
Disabling DHCP for Pure Switch Use:

To use a router purely as a switch, the DHCP server on the router needs to be disabled.
When DHCP is disabled, the router will no longer assign IP addresses, and an existing DHCP server (usually on your main router) will handle that task.
Connection Setup:

Connect one of the LAN ports of the router (not the WAN port) to your main network or modem.
Use the other LAN ports to connect your devices. This bypasses the router's NAT (Network Address Translation) and routing functions.
IP Configuration:

Assign a static IP address to the router within the subnet of your main network to avoid conflicts (e.g., if your main router's IP is 192.168.1.1, set this one to 192.168.1.2).
Wireless Access Point (Optional):

If the router has Wi-Fi, it can also serve as a wireless access point while functioning as a switch.
Limitations
Performance: Routers generally have fewer LAN ports compared to dedicated switches, so they may not scale well for large networks.
Advanced Features: Dedicated switches often provide advanced features like VLANs, which most consumer-grade routers do not support.
Configuration Effort: Setting up a router as a switch requires some manual configuration, while a standalone switch works out of the box.
